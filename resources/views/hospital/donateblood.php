        <p>There is no SUBSTITUTE FOR BLOOD!</p>

        <p>Despite all medical advances, we have found no way of duplicating it except in our own bodies.</p>

        <p>Only a HUMAN being can donate and help another human being.</p>

        <p>It feels great to donate!</p>

        <p>It’s something you can spare most people have blood to spare… yet, there is still not enough to go around.</p>

        <p>You will help ensure blood is on the shelf when needed most people don’t think they’ll ever need blood, many do.</p>

        <p>You will be someone’s hero in fact, you will help as many as three people with just one donation</p>
